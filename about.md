# The reason behind creating this website

The reason is simple. I'm currently studying webdevelopment and there was a need to create a site from where it was possible to submit assignments.
Since this site is constructed using Jekyll it is quite simple to update and therefore it is a great tool that meets the current needs of the studies.

If it is possible to use this site throughout the program it will be a great way to collect the different things i will learn in one place. 

For this page i will use a layout called **{{page.layout}}**.
