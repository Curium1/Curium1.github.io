The humans.txt files is a very simple way to present the people behind the site, some basic information about it such as latest update and available languages. It is also possible to specify the IDEs used if following the standard.

In the humans.txt file for this site i have chosen to include Johan and John as they have published the base of the exercise on GitHub and i have also chosen to include Visual Studio Code and Paint.net as IDEs. I could have included Docker and Jekyll here as well.
